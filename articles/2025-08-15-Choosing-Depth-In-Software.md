In about 2 months I'll be 28 years-old. By Rudolf Steiner's 7-Year Cycles of Life [1], that means I'm entering a new cycle that runs from 28 to 35.

According to Steiner, earlier cycles were important for establishing identity and independence. **Experimenting with new things** is particularly useful in early life, as this is the only way of (hopefully) discovering what you enjoy and want to pursue long-term.

For my IT career, I experimented _a lot_. Every technology on this list is something I spent at least 50 hours working with professionally, learning, or just tinkering. And to make it more interesting, I'll be listing the exact order I encountered them: Windows, C++, Linux, Java, Vim, Git, Python, OpenCV, Pytorch, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, MySQL, Firebase, React, Django, C#, .NET, Docker, Sqlite, Rust, PHP, Laravel, Vue, MacOS, AWS, Typescript, Go, Angular, PostgreSQL, WebRTC, Elixir and Phoenix.

Exploring all these technologies gave me a solid sense of their differences and similarities. At one point, I even called myself a **tech agnostic**, which I now kinda cringe at. Honestly, most of these languages and tools are solving the same fundamental problems, just with different tradeoffs.

Still, I don't think any of this time was wasted. Without those experiments I wouldn't be where I am today, and certainly not writing this article. For example, back in university I was convinced I'd go into an AI career until I tried it and realized it's mostly about math, dataset processing and far less about the systems programming I enjoy.

## Mastering None

Having many casual interests and hobbies like the 40-year-old Virgin, although it's a little bit weird and arguably not optimal, seems fine to me as they are mostly for fun. **But when it comes to serious stuff like your career, dividing your attention across too many things is a real problem.**

Developing the amazing ability to "learn" a new technology from scratch and start using it as fast as possible _seems_ useful but in practice it is a **remarkably useless skill**, especially in the current LLM age where companies can just pay an AI to write the kind of code a person would write in this scenario.

The idea here is clear: **You master none**. It's extremely hard to achieve _excellence_ in many things given the limited free time a normal adult has.

In software, excellence means deep understanding of **system architecture, reliability, security, maintainability and performance.** Those are things you only improve by building depth over time in one domain.

## Focusing

A while ago I shifted from experimenting too much to pure focus. My strategy was simple: pick a language and specialize in its ecosystem and the kind of software that language is usually used to build.

I picked Rust because I love its design and ecosystem, plus how it aligns with the systems programming I enjoy. There were other practical reasons, like its reliability and market potential, but this article isn't about Rust.

After committing to a single path, work just felt much lighter. There's no more overhead about choosing tools, I only focus on architecture, coding and shipping. Also my productivity and satisfaction increased a lot.

## Closing

Experimentation is great, that's how you find what you enjoy. But once you find it, **know when to stop and start building depth.**
